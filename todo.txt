we will only implement broadcasting
everything is a room, if there are 2 people, then its just a chat
else its a group

broadcasint requires a list of connections to write message

suppose a room is there with 5 people, personA opens the chat, so he should be now in the clientList of the that room
we can infer that room is a database object, and the clientList attached to it is memory based, as someone closes the browser, the clientList will be reset to 0.

so how we will associate a room with a client list ?
